# DroughtPercipitation
Our goal for this project was to have a small part in minimizing the damages of drought and climate change in the future, based on the error rate and numbers that our program produced, we believe these numbers could give researchers some ideas about the future of precipitation rate in the world. All the program is based on the Spark platform.
